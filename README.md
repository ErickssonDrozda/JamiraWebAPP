## Languages of Development

Frontend: Using razor pages for dynamic website, implemented with css, and javascript.  
Backend: C# using Entity framework.

## How it works
This is a car entry and exit simulator, where the system has two types of users: the consumer and the parking.

### Initial page for customers
- Here you can see a dashboard with lastest parkings and below the last transactions to buy credits.  
- The menu on the left side you can see informations about your car, the simulator and personal infos.
